## Copenhagen: The Coffee Capital

The Capital Region dominates with the highest concentration of roasteries in the Nordics. Names like Coffee Collective, April Coffee Roasters, and LA CABRA have put Denmark on the world coffee map.

## Beyond Copenhagen

Don't sleep on the rest of Denmark. Aarhus alone has 9 roasteries, making it Denmark's second coffee capital. And smaller towns like Vejle, Svendborg, and Ebeltoft are home to passionate micro-roasters doing exceptional work.
